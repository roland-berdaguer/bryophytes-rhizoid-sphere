running DADA2 on bryophytes 16S data with Ernakovich pipeline

scripts for processing bryophytes 16S data are ordered 00 to 07 and are located in: /lustre/BIF/nobackup/berda001/ernakovich_lab_pipeline/dada2_ernakovichlab-main/bryophytes_16S/R_16S/
before running the scripts with R, activate conda with conda activate dada2_ernakovich. this conda environment was created using dada2_ernakovich.yml, which is located in /lustre/BIF/nobackup/berda001/metabolomics/ernakovich_lab_pipeline/dada2_ernakovichlab-main/
The conda environment (.yml file) is available at: https://github.com/ErnakovichLab/dada2_ernakovichlab

raw NovaSeq data from the bryophytes experiment is located in /lustre/BIF/nobackup/berda001/novaseq_data/bryophytes/16S

the project folder path is defined in the script as /lustre/BIF/nobackup/berda001/ernakovich_lab_pipeline/bryophytes_project_folder_16S/
final results end up in the project folder, in a subfolder called 03_tabletax
