running DADA2 on bryophytes ITS data with Ernakovich pipeline

scripts for processing bryophytes ITS data are ordered 00 to 07 and are located in: /lustre/BIF/nobackup/berda001/ernakovich_lab_pipeline/dada2_ernakovichlab-main/bryophytes_ITS/R_ITS/
before running the scripts with R, activate conda with conda activate dada2_ernakovich. this conda environment was created using dada2_ernakovich.yml, which is located in /lustre/BIF/nobackup/berda001/ernakovich_lab_pipeline/dada2_ernakovichlab-main/
The conda environment (.yml file) is available at: https://github.com/ErnakovichLab/dada2_ernakovichlab

raw NovaSeq data from the bryophytes experiment is located in /lustre/BIF/nobackup/berda001/novaseq_data/seq4/bryophytes_ITS

the project folder path is defined in the script as /lustre/BIF/nobackup/berda001/ernakovich_lab_pipeline/bryophytes_ITS/
final results end up in the project folder, in a subfolder called 03_tabletax
