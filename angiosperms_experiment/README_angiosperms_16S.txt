For the angiosperms experiment, MiSeq reads are processed with DADA2 in qiime2.
The qiime2 conda environment first needs to be loaded with "conda activate qiime2-2022.2".

This results in the files "features-table.tsv", "taxonomy.tsv" and "dna-sequences.fasta".
These three files are then used to load the data in the analysis script.
